title: Collatz, collatz, collatz

Dr. Downing has spent this week going through the Collatz project with us, which I appreciate greatly. I think I'm not the only one that initially found our first project to very heavy on the logistics. It seemed like a whole lot of setup and learning specific tools and methodologies and not a whole lot of coding, and I really didn't understand why these tools in particular were important. Fortunately, the last three class days have made everything clearer than I could have ever expected. 

Even now, I'm still less comfortable with the terminal-based coding environment. I no longer have any issues programming with vim or compiling code with gcc (or g++), but I'm still much more comfortable with the conventional IDE that puts error checking, compiling, file linking, and more all into one nice and easy package. However, it really feels like that preference is starting to change with the addition of new tools discussed in class like Travis CI. Travis CI is a streamlined and incredibly easy to use testing "service" that fully tests your files at the most logical time, when you're pushing them to the dev branch. This way, when designing, you know when your new code is functioning and ready for a merge to the master branch. In some ways, I prefer this convenient testing method to more manual testing because it just makes so much sense, workflow-wise.

Dr. Downing's discussion of the Collatz project made me realize how important a good methodology and strong tools can be when getting to work on a new project.

Tip of the day: If you're having any trouble getting started with C++, it helps to write the whole Collatz program in a language that you're familiar with, like Java. It won't take long, and it allows you to approach the C++ syntax one known line at a time later.
