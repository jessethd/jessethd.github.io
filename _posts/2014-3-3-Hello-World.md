It's my first semester taking the "big kid" classes; after four semesters of linearly structured (and rightfully so) courses, we're free to make our choice amongst the (unfortunately mostly closed) upper-division courses. I'd call myself lucky as I managed to get into two great upper division CS classes, this one being one of them. Professor Downing had a strong reputation that did not escape me as I trudged through 429 and 439, and I'm glad to say that based on my first two days in class, that reputation is well-deserved.

What impressed me most right off the bat was his emphasis on making us all "employment ready". This attitude is very welcomed as it comes at such an important time for all of us, but most especially myself. While I've attended the CNS career fairs and the UTCS bonus career fair, I've always been there mostly as an observer; my resume was never fully prepared and I was never confident enough to speak to more than 5 or so people. I spent my summer working to change that, by establishing a more complete resume with strong in-class projects and my FRI research experience. 

And so I was very happy when the first class day he detailed this emphasis, and then went on to prove it on Friday when he talked about asserts (a general topic to ease us back into things) and the more correct way to create tests in production code. I was very surprised that I hadn't heard of gcov before lecture because it seems like a fantastically objective way to determine what tests are "good" tests. Very practical and very important, and I'm excited to see just how true this is as the semester goes on.

Tip of the day: If you're having trouble setting up all of the required software for the class on your Windows machine, I highly recommend going the VM route (as recommended by a TA) if you aren't taxed for memory on your machine. I dualbooted my laptop with Linux Mint back in 429 but couldn't abandon Windows entirely on my desktop for video game compatibility reasons mostly, so a VirtualBox VM is the next best thing. It's arguably even better, as I can run Windows and Linux simultaneously. If you need any help getting this set up, post a comment on my followup and I can get you started!
